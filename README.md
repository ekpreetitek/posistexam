# posistexam

I have used Treeset here since it internally works as Red Black Binary trees and adds data in sorted way.
PosistExam.java is the main file where asked tasks are done.
Two java classes that is Node.java and OwnerData.java has been made .

Node.java consists of the entire structure of the node(as asked).
Moreover, composition is used here. (object of OwnerData is made)

OwnerData.java consists of all the necessary details of owner.

ENcrypt() function is written in OwnerData.java class as for encryption.
